# Introduction

Cloud Eye (CES) is a free tool for monitoring Huawei Cloud resources. In addition to resource monitoring, Cloud Eye can also be used to create event- or metric-based alarms, identify resource malfunctions, and quickly react to resource changes. It is worth noting that, although Cloud Eye is a free service, **charges for sending notifications when alarms are triggered are charged**.

This document aims to describe the main functionalities of the Cloud Eye service and guide the reader to use CES for monitoring cloud resources, such as ECSs, VPNs, and CBRs, etc. In addition, it also describes how to create event- or metric-based alarms and customize dashboards for resource monitoring.

# Cloud Eye on the console

## Overview

When you open Cloud Eye on the console, the home page that will load is the
Overview, where you can see an overview of all resources
used in Huawei Cloud, the overall network, CPU, memory, and disk
utilization, and which resources have recently triggered alarms and need
further attention.

- <span class="underline">Resource Overview:</span> Allows you to
view the total number of monitored resources and the alarms
generated for these resources.

- <span class="underline">Alarm Statistics:</span> Shows the
alarms triggered in the last seven days by alarm severity.

- <span class="underline">Server Monitoring:</span> Allows you to
view the overall CPU and memory utilization of
monitored servers and a list of the top 5 ECSs ranked by CPU or
memory utilization.

- <span class="underline">Network Monitoring:</span> Shows the
overall bandwidth utilization of EIPs and a list of the top 5
EIPs ranked by bandwidth utilization.

- <span class="underline">Storage Monitoring:</span>
Allows you to view the overall disk utilization (EVS) by read and write IOPS
and a list of the top 5 disks ranked by IOPS.

You can see what the Cloud Eye home page looks like in the images below:

## Resource groups

Resource groups allow you to group multiple Huawei Cloud resources for joint monitoring, and also facilitate the management of alarms for multiple resources in batches.

A resource group can be created in the **Resource Groups** section by clicking **Create Resource Group**.

{% include image.html post=page.path file="image5.png" %}

On the page that loads, choose a name for the resource group in
**Name** and select the resources to add to the group by
service. After adding all the desired resources, click
**Create**.

{% include image.html post=page.path file="image6.png" %}

You can create alarms for a specific resource group,
making it easy to create batch alarms for multiple resources that
share the same context.

{% include image.html post=page.path file="image7.png" %}

## Alarm management

The alarm management section has the following subsections:

- <span class="underline">Alarm rules:</span> Subsection used
to view and create alarms based on metrics or events.

- <span class="underline">Alarm history:</span> Subsection
used to view triggered alarms.

- <span class="underline">Alarm template:</span> Subsection
related to viewing alarm templates.

- <span class="underline">One-click monitoring:</span> Subsection
that allows you to enable monitoring for common service events

- <span class="underline">Alarm mask:</span> Subsection that
allows you to create alarm masks so that triggered alarms
are not notified.

### Creating an alarm

To create an alarm for a specific resource based on an event or
metric, navigate to the **Alarm Rules** section in **Alarm Management**
and click **Create Alarm Rule**.

{% include image.html post=page.path file="image8.png" %}

Configure the basic alarm settings, such as the alarm name in
**Name** and the type of resource to be monitored in **Resource Type**,
as well as its scope in **Dimension**. To configure an alarm for
an ECS, for example, the **Resource Type** is Elastic Cloud Server and the
**Dimension** is ECSs.

If the alarm triggering condition is a metric, such as
the ECS CPU or memory utilization rate, select Metric in
**Alarm Type**. If the alarm triggering condition is an event, for example, the event of an uninstalled GPU, select Event in the **Alarm Type** field. In this example, the metric to trigger the alarm will be the ECS CPU utilization above 80%. 

In **Monitoring Scope**, the specific resource that will trigger the alarm must be configured. The resource can be selected in three different ways: 
- <span class="underline">All resources</span>: Select this option if the alarm can be triggered by all instances of the selected resource. 
- <span class="underline">Resource groups</span>: Select this option if the alarm can be triggered by all resources present in a resource group. See section 3.3. 
- <span class="underline">Specific resources</span>: Select this option to choose a specific instance of the selected service to trigger the alarm. 

{% include image.html post=page.path file="image9.png" %}

In this example, the ECS “ecs-4194” will be selected as the instance that
can trigger the alarm in the **Specific resources** field under **Monitoring
Scope**.

{% include image.html post=page.path file="image10.png" %}

There are three different ways to configure the metric that will trigger the
alarm in **Method**:

- <span class="underline">Associate template:</span> In this option, the
metric to trigger the alarm will be configured based on an
existing template.

- <span class="underline">Use existing template</span>: In this option, the metric to trigger the alarm will be configured based on an existing template.

- <span class="underline">Configure manually</span>: In this option, the metric to trigger the alarm will be configured manually, which allows for greater flexibility.

In this example, the metric that will be configured to trigger the alarm will be if the ECS CPU usage is greater than or equal to 80%. In **Metric Name**, it is possible to select the metric that can trigger the alarm, as in this case it is **(Agent) CPU Usage (Recommended)**. For this option to be selected, the Cloud Eye agent must be installed, as done in section 3.5. It is important that the agent is installed on monitored servers to obtain better accuracy in data monitoring and a wider range of monitoring metrics.

In **Alarm Policy**, you can select the type of data that will be analyzed, such as raw data, average, maximum, minimum, variance or sum of the ingested data; as well as the percentage that will trigger the alarm and the form of comparison, such as greater than or equal, greater than, less than, less than or equal, increase in relation to or decrease in relation to.

{% include image.html post=page.path file="image11.png" %}

In the **Alarm Notification** section, you can configure a notification for alarms triggered by email, SMS, HTTP and HTTPS requests or through a trigger in FunctionGraph. If the notification only needs to be sent to the email of the account owner in the Huawei Cloud console, you can select the **Account contact** option in **Notification Object** directly. In this example, a second email address will be configured to receive notifications of Cloud Eye alarms. To do this, you must first enable the Short Message Notification (SMN) service. {% include image.html post=page.path file="image12.png" %} Click **Topics** to view the notification topics that you have created. {% include image.html post=page.path file="image13.png" %} Click **Create Topic** to create a notification topic. {% include image.html post=page.path file="image14.png" %}

Enter the name of the notification topic in **Topic Name** and click
**OK**.

{% include image.html post=page.path file="image15.png" %}

Next, click **Add Subscription** to add a communication channel through which the notification will be sent.

{% include image.html post=page.path file="image16.png" %}

Next, choose the protocol for sending the notification, in this case
**Email**, and enter the chosen email in **Endpoints**. Click
**OK**.

{% include image.html post=page.path file="image17.png" %}

An email will be sent to the selected endpoint. For the SMN service to work correctly, the user must confirm their email through a confirmation that will be sent as soon as the **Subscription** is configured.

Returning to the alarm creation, select the topic created in the previous steps in **Notification Object** and configure the time window in which the notification can be sent in **Notification Window**.

In addition, also select the occasions in which the notification will be sent in the **Trigger Condition**: when the alarm is generated or when the
alarm is cleared. After configuring, select **Create** to create the
alarm.

{% include image.html post=page.path file="image18.png" %}

In **Alarm Rules** you can see the created alarms and their statuses,
as well as the resource that is monitored and the alarm activation policy.

{% include image.html post=page.path file="image19.png" %}

After an alarm is triggered, you can view it in the **Alarm
Records** section in **Alarm Management**.

{% include image.html post=page.path file="image20.png" %}

You can also view the notification generated by the alarm on the endpoint selected for sending the notification in the SMN service. In another context, the following email was generated for monitoring a bucket in the OBS service for object storage in Huawei Cloud:

{% include image.html post=page.path file="image21.png" %}

The tables for the metrics and events monitored for Huawei Cloud ECS, VPN, NAT, and CBR services have been included in the appendices section 4.0 of this document. To create event-based alarms or metrics for these services, the procedure is the same as that described above.
